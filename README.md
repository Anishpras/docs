# Introduction

Streamflow Finance a suite of payment-related products that enable teams, businesses, investors or any other organization (or individual) to distribute funds in a simple and straightforward manner.

## Overview

Please take a look at our presentation: [https://docsend.com/view/fcj9m8c4eaniai98](https://docsend.com/view/fcj9m8c4eaniai98)

## Motivation

Crypto-native businesess lack easy-to-use tools for basic use cases like token vesting, payroll, mass payouts, multi-signature treasuries. Without these tools we cannot have efficiant and highly functioning organizations.

We're building protocols, SDKs and applications to bridge those gaps and help organizations remove that overhead and save time.
