# Introduction

Streamflow is a suite of products that enables organizations (and individuals) to distribute funds in a simple and straightforward manner.

## Motivation

Crypto-native businesses lack easy-to-use tools to do token vesting, payroll for team members and contributors, to have multi-signature treasuries, etc.

Without these tools we cannot have efficient and highly functioning organizations. Streamflow solves this.

We're building protocols, SDKs and applications to bridge those gaps and help organizations **stream**line aforementioned processes and save time and money.

## Vision

To make basic crypto-native financial workflows ~~simple~~ **not suck.**

## Mission

Facilitate everyday financial workflows and payment-related tasks by creating decentralized, permissionless and trust-minimized protocols, SDKs and applications.

Our initial suite of products includes a protocol for **streaming payments** and solutions for **token vesting** and **progressive payroll** built on top of it. In addition, we're bringing one-to-many payments and multisig vaults on Solana.

Our aim is to make these services widely adopted by being the payment "rails" and enabling seamless integration of our services within other applications.

Staring with Solana ecosystem, then expanding cross-chain and onboarding traditional (web2) projects.

Last, but not least, we are dedicated to utilizing blockchain technology advancements to stay at the frontline of a financial shift taking place in the world.
