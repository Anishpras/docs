### What’s the difference between community and commercial version of Streamflow token vesting?

Streamflow (**commercial**) token vesting app also comes up with powerful additional features such as giving a Subject/Title to the contract, auto-withdrawal feature, referral system. You can also choose who gets the authority to cancel or transfer the vesting contract stream from sender/recipient. This version has [fees.md](fees.md "mention").
