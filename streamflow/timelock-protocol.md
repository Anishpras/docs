# Protocol

At the core of **Streamflow** is a protocol for streaming payments, that acts like a time-lock escrow service for funds.&#x20;

This basic financial primitive is a building block for many payment-related use cases, such as

* Risk-minimized trial period
* Token vesting
* Progressive payroll
* Continuous fundraising & donations
* Subscriptions
* ... any pay-per-usage use case.
